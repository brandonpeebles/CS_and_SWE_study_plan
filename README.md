## What is this?
<p>This living document is my study plan for computer science and software engineering topics.  Given my previous experience in analytics/operations plus education in industrial & systems engineering, it’s been tailored to specifically fill my own knowledge gaps and prepare me for a role in software engineering. It outlines what I’m covering (in roughly the order I plan to cover it) as well as serves as a way to track my progress. I will be focusing on core computer science topics/concepts, full-stack JavaScript web development, and Python.</p>

## Data Structures

- ### Arrays
    - Implement an automatically resizing vector.
    - [X] Description:
        - [Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/OsBSF/arrays)
        - [UC Berkeley CS61B - Linear and Multi-Dim Arrays (video)](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley_webcast_Wp8oiO_CZZE) (Start watching from 15m 32s)
        - [Basic Arrays (video)](https://archive.org/details/0102WhatYouShouldKnow/02_04-basicArrays.mp4)
        - [Multi-dim (video)](https://archive.org/details/0102WhatYouShouldKnow/02_05-multidimensionalArrays.mp4)
        - [Dynamic Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/EwbnV/dynamic-arrays)
        - [Jagged Arrays (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jtrQqYpt7g)
        - [Jagged Arrays (video)](https://archive.org/details/0102WhatYouShouldKnow/02_06-jaggedArrays.mp4)
        - [Resizing arrays (video)](https://archive.org/details/0102WhatYouShouldKnow/03_01-resizableArrays.mp4)
    - [X] Implement a vector/dynamic array class (mutable array with automatic resizing):
        - [X] size() - number of items
        - [X] capacity() - number of items it can hold
        - [X] at(index) - returns item at given index, blows up if index out of bounds
        - [X] push(item)
        - [X] insert(index, item) - inserts item at index, shifts that index's value and trailing elements to the right
        - [X] prepend(item) - can use insert above at index 0
        - [X] pop() - remove from end, return value
        - [X] delete(index) - delete item at index, shifting all trailing elements left
        - [X] remove(item) - looks for value and removes index holding it (even if in multiple places)
        - [X] find(item) - looks for value and returns first index with that value, -1 if not found
        - [X] resize(new_capacity) // private function
            - when you reach capacity, resize to double the size
            - when popping an item, if size is 1/4 of capacity, resize to half
    - [X] Time
        - O(1) to add/remove at end (amortized for allocations for more space), index, or update
        - O(n) to insert/remove elsewhere
    - [X] Space
        - contiguous in memory, so proximity helps performance
        - space needed = (array capacity, which is >= n) * size of item, but even if 2n, still O(n)

- ### Linked Lists
    - [X] General concept via textbook
    - [X] Linked List vs Arrays:
        - [Core Linked Lists Vs Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance/lecture/rjBs9/core-linked-lists-vs-arrays)
        - [In The Real World Linked Lists Vs Arrays (video)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures-optimizing-performance/lecture/QUaUd/in-the-real-world-lists-vs-arrays)
    - [X] implement:
        - [X] size() - returns number of data elements in list
        - [X] empty() - bool returns true if empty
        - [X] value_at(index) - returns the value of the nth item (starting at 0 for first)
        - [X] push_front(value) - adds an item to the front of the list
        - [X] pop_front() - remove front item and return its value
        - [X] push_back(value) - adds an item at the end
        - [X] pop_back() - removes end item and returns its value
        - [X] front() - get value of front item
        - [X] back() - get value of end item
        - [X] insert(index, value) - insert value at index, so current item at that index is pointed to by new item at index
        - [X] erase(index) - removes node at given index
        - [X] value_n_from_end(n) - returns the value of the node at nth position from the end of the list
        - [X] reverse() - reverses the list
        - [X] remove_value(value) - removes the first item in the list with this value
    - [X] Doubly-linked List
        - [Description (video)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/jpGKD/doubly-linked-lists)
        - No need to implement

- ### Stack
    - [X] [Stacks (video)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/lecture/UdKzQ/stacks)
    - [X] [Using Stacks Last-In First-Out (video)](https://archive.org/details/0102WhatYouShouldKnow/05_01-usingStacksForLast-inFirst-out.mp4)
    - [X] Will not implement. Implementing with array is trivial.

- ### Queue
    - [x] Implement using linked-list, with tail pointer:
        - enqueue(value) - adds value at position at tail
        - dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element (front)
        - empty()
    - [x] Implement using fixed-sized array:
        - enqueue(value) - adds item at end of available storage
        - dequeue() - returns value and removes least recently added element
        - empty()
        - full()
    - [x] Cost:
        - a bad implementation using linked list where you enqueue at head and dequeue at tail would be O(n)
            because you'd need the next to last element, causing a full traversal each dequeue
        - enqueue: O(1) (amortized, linked list and array [probing])
        - dequeue: O(1) (linked list and array)
        - empty: O(1) (linked list and array)

## Sorting

- [ ] Notes:
    - Implement sorts & know best case/worst case, average complexity of each:
        - no bubble sort - it's terrible - O(n^2), except when n <= 16

## Graphs

Graphs can be used to represent many problems in computer science, so this section is long, like trees and sorting were.

- Notes:
    - There are 4 basic ways to represent a graph in memory:
        - objects and pointers
        - adjacency matrix
        - adjacency list
        - adjacency map
    - Familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros & cons
    - BFS and DFS - know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs, and how to implement them in real code
    - When asked a question, look for a graph-based solution first, then move on if none.

## Even More Knowledge

- ### Dynamic Programming
    - You probably won't see any dynamic programming problems in your interview, but it's worth being able to recognize a problem as being a candidate for dynamic programming.
    - This subject can be pretty difficult, as each DP soluble problem must be defined as a recursion relation, and coming up with it can be tricky.
    - I suggest looking at many examples of DP problems until you have a solid understanding of the pattern involved.

        - Thread resource needs (shares above (minus stack) with other threads in the same process but each has its own pc, stack counter, registers, and stack)
        - Forking is really copy on write (read-only) until the new process writes to memory, then it does a full copy.
