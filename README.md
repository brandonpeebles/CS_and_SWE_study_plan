## What is this?
> This living document is my study plan for computer science and software engineering topics.  Given my previous experience in analytics/operations plus education in industrial & systems engineering, it’s been customized to fill my knowledge gaps and prepare me for a role in software engineering. It outlines what I’m covering as well as serve as a way to track my progress.
